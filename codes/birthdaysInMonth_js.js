//You are asked by the head of Human Resources to compile a list of birthdays in a given month. Write a function which accepts an array with a structure similar to "birthdayCollection", as well as a month. Name this function "birthdaysInMonth"; it should return an array of strings with a Month and Day separated by a white space.

var birthdaysInMonth = function(birthdayObjs){
    //Your code here
}

//Result:
birthdaysInMonth(birthdayCollection, "February"); //[ 'February 10', 'February 7', 'February 18' ]
